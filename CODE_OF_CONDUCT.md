## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- The main **Safexpr** GitHub repository and related repositories  
- Issue trackers, pull requests, and code reviews  
- Project communication channels (e.g. discussions, forums, chat, etc.)  
- Public spaces where you represent the project or community  

This includes both online and offline interactions whenever the project or its community is involved.

---

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers (including **TheSkiF4er**) are responsible for:

- Clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior  
- Responding appropriately to any behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful  
- Taking fair and consistent corrective action when violations occur  

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Edit or remove comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct  
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful  

---

## Reporting a Problem

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or if you have any concerns, please report it as soon as possible.

You can contact the project maintainer at:

- **Email:** `SafExpr@cajeer.co `  
- Or via a **private GitHub message / direct contact** if available

When reporting, please include:

- A description of what happened  
- Links, screenshots, or other relevant context (if possible)  
- Date and approximate time of the incident  
- Whether the behavior is ongoing  

Your report will be handled with care and confidentiality.  
We will not publicly disclose your identity without your consent, except if required by law.

---

## Enforcement

All reports will be reviewed and investigated as appropriate.

Possible actions include, but are not limited to:

- A private warning  
- A request for an apology or clarification  
- Temporary or permanent ban from the project’s spaces  
- Reverting or removing contributions that violate the Code of Conduct  

The maintainers will always try to:

- Act fairly and consistently  
- Listen to all sides involved  
- Prioritize the safety and well-being of the community  

If you disagree with an enforcement decision, you may raise it respectfully with the maintainer for further discussion. However, repeated arguing against clearly communicated decisions may itself be considered a violation.

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

When determining the consequences of an action, maintainers may consider:

1. **Impact** – How severe was the impact on individuals or the community?  
2. **Intent** – Was the behavior intentional, reckless, or accidental?  
3. **History** – Is this a repeated pattern of behavior or a first-time issue?  
4. **Response** – Did the person take responsibility and show a willingness to improve?  

These factors help guide consistent and fair responses.

---

## No Retaliation

The community will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who:

- Reports a suspected violation  
- Cooperates in an investigation  
- Helps enforce this Code of Conduct  

If you believe you have experienced retaliation, please report it using the same reporting channels.

---

## A Note on Disagreements

Disagreements and differences of opinion are normal in any project.

- Disagree with ideas, not people.  
- Be open to being wrong and to changing your mind.  
- If you feel a conversation is turning unproductive or heated, take a break or step away.  

Maintainers may step in to de-escalate or close discussions that are no longer constructive.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and influenced by:

- General open source community best practices  
- Common patterns used in many modern open source Codes of Conduct  

It has been adapted specifically for the **Safexpr** project, maintained by **[TheSkiF4er](https://github.com/TheSkiF4er)**.
